The Central Maryland Ultimate Association (CMUA) will be offering three 
separate leagues this summer.  Two will be co-ed and the third will be a new gender-blind Open league.  All leagues are open to all skill levels. Participate in one or two or all of the leagues for the same price ($20.00).<br>
<h4>The Monday Night League - Our classic Co-ed summer league</h4>
<ul>
<li>Who:
    <ul>
    <li>Adult Ultimate players of all skill levels and genders are invited to play.  There is limited space for both men and women in this league, so be sure to sign up early!

    </ul>
<li>What:
    <ul>
    <li> A 16 team mixed format league.
    <li> Teams are formed via a draft of all the registered players by volunteer captains.
    <li> The mixed format for this league is 5/2 or 4/3 - offense chooses.
    <li> Two rounds are played every Monday night.
    </ul>
<li>Where:
    <ul>
    <li> Regular season games are played at fields in the Catonsville, Woodlawn, and Lansdowne areas.
    <li> Playoff games are also played in the same areas, but some games may be played farther afield (e.g. Columbia) in order to provide lighted fields for all games.
    </ul>
<li>When:
    <ul> 
    <li> Registration is held during the month of May.  The Deadline is May 27, but this league always fills up prior to the deadline!
    <li> Games are played from June to mid-August. 
    <li> First round games are scheduled to start at 6:30 PM and the last round typically ends around 9 PM.  Longer rounds are played on fields with lights; hence plan on playing till 10 PM on those evenings.
    </ul>
</ul>

<h4>The Wednesday Night League - AKA The Clique &amp; Pick League.</h4>

    </ul>
<li> What:
    <ul>
    <li> An 8 to 10 team modified-mixed format league.
    <li> Teams are formed via a two part process:
        <ul>
        <li> A clique of up to 7 players is formed prior to the draft.  (Someone from the clique must notify the league commissioner of their intent to create a team by the sign up deadline of May 27.)
        <li> A leader from the clique attends the draft and picks the rest of the team.
        </ul>
    <li> The mixed format for this league is determined at game time each week and is based on the number of women in attendance that evening.
    <li> One lengthy game is played each week, but an occasional double header may be required in order to make up a rained out game.
    </ul>
<li> Where: 
    <ul>
    <li> All games are played at fields in the Catonsville area. 
    </ul>
<li> When:

    </ul>
<li>What:
    <ul>
    <li> A 4 to 6 team Open format league. “Open format” typically translates into “Men’s league,” but women are welcomed to join as long as they are willing to match up against anyone (male or female) on the other team.
    <li> Teams are formed via a two part process:
        <ul>
        <li> A computer will be used to perform the initial draft based on the self ratings provided on the registration forms.
        <li> A committee will review the draft and correct any obvious imbalances.
        </ul>

<h4>Registration Information:</h4>

<strong>To register</strong>: simply fill out this form and click "submit registration".
The next page will tell you how to pay either online or by check.<br><br>
<strong>Under 18?</strong> The summer leagues offered by the CMUA are geared towards the adult
player. Players under the age of 18 (as of June 1) may register for a Summer
League only if they have an adult sponsor within that league. It is preferred
that the sponsor be an immediate family member, however a family friend is
acceptable. An adult player that the underage player just met at a pick-up
game is not an appropriate sponsor. When registering, the underage player must
list his/her sponsor on the "Optional Chum Declaration" line.  Additionally,
he/she may not register online, since we require the parent's signature on the
<a href="/static/summer_2011_reg_form.pdf">registration form.</a><br><br>
